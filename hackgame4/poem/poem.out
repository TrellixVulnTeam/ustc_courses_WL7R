---------
There is something in this world
that no one has ever seen before.
It is gentle and sweet.
Maybe if it could be seen,
everyone would fight over it.
That is why the world hid it,
so that no one could get their hands
on it so easily.
However, someday, someone will find it.
The person who deserves it the most
will definitely find it.

Do you like this school?
I really, really love it.
But nothing can stay unchanged.
Fun things... Happy things...
They can't all possibly stay unchanged.
Even so,
can you go on loving this place?
---------
Sometimes I wonder,
what if this town was alive?
What if it had thoughts and feelings
like one of us?
If it did,
I think it would want to make the people
who live here happy.
---------
Expectations are what you have
when you have given up.
Expectations are born from
a despairingly large difference in skill.
---------
A joke only lasts for a moment,
if it leaves a misunderstanding,
it becomes a lie.
---------
If someone didn't have any pride,
wouldn't they also be lacking
in self-confidence?
If someone was free of greed,
wouldn't they have trouble
supporting their family?
And if people didn't envy one another,
wouldn't they stop inventing new things?
---------
If I don't have to do it, I won't.
If I have to do it, I'll make it.
