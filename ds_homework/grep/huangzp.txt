huangzp is the most smart person I have ever seen.
How do I let you meet me,
At my most beautiful moment .                  
For this,
I beseeched  the Buddha  for five hundred years, 
I beseeched him to let us meet in earthly  life.  
Buddha let me become a tree,
Growing on the roadside that you pass by every day.
Under the sunlight,
It carefully bloomed with flowers all over,
Every bloom is my longing from a previous  life.
When you come near,
Please listen carefully ,
Those shivering  leaves,
Are the passion of my waiting.
And when you finally  passed by unawares 
Those that fell off and covered the ground,
Friends,
Those are not flower petals ,
Those are my withering  heart.
long live the debian.
